<B>What is the World Wide Web?</B>
<p>The World Wide Web is comprised of a collection of <em>HTML</em> Documents. When a person accesses a website through a web browser, the computer sends and HTTP request through a server,
and retrieves the correct HTML Document, which a <em>web browser</em> is then able to interpret and display.

<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>- Stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p> 
<p>- Is the language predominantly used for content on the web.</p>
<p>- Consists of <em>text content</em> (what you see) & <em>markup</em> (what it looks like</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a> is a good refresher.</p><br>
<b>Elements & Tags</b>
<p>- HTML markup consists of <em>tags</em>. There are serparate opening and closing tags, with the content (text) between the tags being affected.</p>
<p>- Opening tags generally look like < b > , while closing tags look almost identical, but with an added backslack < / b ></p>
<p>- The tags & content together are known as an <em>element</em>. HTML documents consist of many elements.</p>
<p>- Some tags do not need a closing tag, these are called <em>void</em> tags.</p>
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> Here</a> is a video that explains further.</p><br>
<b> Inline & Block Elements </b>
<p>- Elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em></p>
<p> - Block elements form an invisible box around the text.</p>
<p> - So far inline elements are void tags, while block elements are not.</p><br>
<b> Additional informaion</b>
<p> - There is <b><em>A LOT</em></b> of information to remember.  It isn't important to memorize all the tags. That is what online resources are for!</p>
<p> - There is a lot to learn, but plenty of places to turn for help! </p>
